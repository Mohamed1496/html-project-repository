            Problem solving, particularly in artificial intelligence,
             may be characterized as a systematic search through a range of possible actions in order to reach some predefined goal or solution.
             Problem-solving methods divide into special purpose and general purpose.
             A special-purpose method is tailor-made for a particular problem and often exploits very specific features of the situation in which the problem is embedded.
             In contrast, a general-purpose method is applicable to a wide variety of problems.
             One general-purpose technique used in AI is means-end analysis—a step-by-step, or incremental, reduction of the difference between the current state and the final goal.
             The program selects actions from a list of means—in the case of a simple robot this might consist of PICKUP, 
             PUTDOWN, MOVEFORWARD, MOVEBACK, MOVELEFT, and MOVERIGHT—until the goal is reached.
             Many diverse problems have been solved by artificial intelligence programs.
            Some examples are finding the winning move (or sequence of moves) in a board game,
            devising mathematical proofs, and manipulating “virtual objects” in a computer-generated world.
